 <h2>Phase I</h2>
 single dose intravenous study (infusion over 2 min ) <i><b>DMK Pharmaceutical inc.</i></b> therapeutic thesis is that, as in the case of encephalin, the respiratory depression caused by mu agonism is counteracted by delta agonism and the abuse potential is counteracted by kappa agonism. DRUG is a new chemical entity with mixed opioid receptor agonism. It binds to human mu, delta & kappa opioid receptors with high affinity and at very low concentrations, and acts as an agonist at all 3 receptors (Binding affinity [Ki values] ~0.7nM). It shows strong anti-nociceptive activity in preclinical pain models with efficacy equivalent to morphine or better. DRUG had a faster onset of action than morphine in animal pain models, following subcutaneous injection. The models were the hot plate efficacy model in rat, inflammatory hyperalgesia rat (CFA) model and rat L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain. In the SNL model of neuropathic pain, the level of analgesia was much better, onset was faster and potency higher than morphine. In the monkey, it was shown to have a significantly lower level of likeability and at a much greater dose threshold than alfentanil. utes) with doses of 5, 10, 20, 25 and 50 ug/kg, demonstrated a good safety profile, linear pharmacokinetics and an elimination half-life of 3 hours, similar to fentanyl. Most common AEs (none considered serious) were somnolence, dizziness and paraesthesia.  For marketed opioids, nausea would be seen first. All AEs resolved spontaneously. No changes in blood pressure; unremarkable ECG and EEG changes. No CNS kappa effects seen such as dysphoria.

<p><h2>Safety and Toxicology</h2>
In preclinical models, compared to mu analgesics, DRUG showed reduced potential for respiratory depression, nausea, constipation and urticaria in rodents, infrequent vomiting in dogs, and substantially reduced abuse potential in non-human primates.  In developmental toxicology studies, the drug was found to be safe. These data suggest that DRUG will have analgesic activity similar to that of morphine and fentanyl but will have a far better tolerability profile. In particular it promises a larger safety margin for respiratory depression and abuse potential which suggests a significant improvement over currently marketed opioid analgesics.
