 <h2>Clinical Data</h2>
Phase I, single dose intravenous study (infusion over 2 minutes) with doses of 5, 10, 20, 25 and 50 ug/kg, demonstrated a good safety profile, linear pharmacokinetics and an elimination half-life of 3 hours, similar to fentanyl. Most common AEs (none considered serious) were somnolence, dizziness and paraesthesia.  For marketed opioids, nausea would be seen first. All AEs resolved spontaneously. No changes in blood pressure; unremarkable ECG and EEG changes. No CNS kappa effects seen such as dysphoria.
</p>
<p><h2>Clinical Plans</h2>
Currently DRUG is only available as an intravenous dosage form and <i><b>DMK Pharmaceutical inc.</i></b> plans to carry out a clinical pharmacology study in normal healthy human volunteers to provide proof of concept and stepwise dose-response evaluation of respiratory function to demonstrate that it has a larger therapeutic window using fentanyl as a comparator.  A dose escalation acute pain study in patients will immediately follow to confirm PK/PD, and will include pupil constriction measurements for additional pharmacodynamic assessment.
To address the larger community based issues, the <i><b>DMK Pharmaceutical inc.</i></b> plans to develop a sublingual tablet or buccal formulation for acute use, and a transdermal patch for chronic use of DRUG for subsequent testing in the clinical setting
